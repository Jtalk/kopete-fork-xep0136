Kopete is now using the new KopeteMessageManager class, for enhanced
integration, and cutdown on code duplication. Unfortunately, not all
plugins have yet been ported. Current HEAD CVS is the "stable" tree
of Kopete; if you want to join in the bleeding edge, please check 
out the KOPETE_KMM_BRANCH branch:

cvs -z4 -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.kde.org:/home/kde co
-r KOPETE_KMM_BRANCH kdenonbeta

Cheers!
Daniel Stone for the Kopete development team
