README for Now Listening Plugin

AUTHOR Will Stephenson <will@stevello.free-online.co.uk>

This plugin tells (currently ALL) your live chats what you're currently listening to.

Caveat: It currently only works with KsCD.  Other media players will be supported shortly.

Caveat 2: It relies on DCOP - I doubt much will happen if you're not running the rest of KDE.

INSTALLATION

Untar into your kopete build tree in kopete/plugins.

Edit kopete/plugins/Makefile.am to include nowlistening in the SUBDIRS

REQUIREMENTS
Requires Xmms remote control header xmmsctrl.h - in SuSE's base xmms rpm at least
Which in turn requires glib-devel and gtk-devel to build.
Configure test doesn't tell us that this is why it bails.

Rerun make -f Makefile.cvs && ./configure - or any subset of that which will
reconfigure the new part of the tree.

make

USE

Enable the plugin in Configure Kopete...->Plugins.  You may wish to change the default message and frequency at which it checks for a changed song.

BUGS

Please report to will@stevello.free-online.co.uk for the time being.

TODO
Add support for Noatun and other media players.
Make it possible to disable the plugin on a per contact basis.
Ditto for each IM protocol.
