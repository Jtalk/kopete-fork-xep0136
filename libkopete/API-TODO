KopeteMessageManager should allow any number of views to be attached, from 0
to infinity.

The chat window should be restructured so each ChatView object has its own
send button.

KopeteMessage should be reorganised to use QDomDocument to store its
contents.

Some sort of async message processing API needs to be designed and implemented
- how do we order the various message filters available properly?
