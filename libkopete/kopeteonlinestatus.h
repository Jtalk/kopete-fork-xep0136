 *
 * KopeteOnlineStatus is a class that encapsulates all information about the
 * various online states that a protocol can be in in a single class. The
 * online status consists of both a 'global' status as it's known to libkopete
 * and used for going online or away, which non-protocol plugins can use,
 * and the 'private' status, which is simply an unsigned int and is only
 * useful for the actual protocol plugin that uses the status.
 *
 * This class is passed around by value, but is refcounted to cut down on the
 * amount of overhead. All in all it should be more than fast enough for
 * general use.
 *
 * Note that ONLY the constructor can set the data, the object is considered
 * to be const after creation as there really shouldn't be a need to change
 * a status' characteristics during runtime!

public:
	/**
	 * The available global statuses. It is possible that multiple internal
	 * states map to the same global statuses. For example ICQ's 'Do not disturb'
	 * is handled just like 'Away' by libkopete. Only ICQ itself makes (and
	 * should make) a distinction.
	 * The order is important and is used in the < or > operator
	 *
	 * - Online  refers to a true online state, i.e. you can be contacted by
	 *         others both technically and practically. This also applies
	 *         to e.g. ICQ's 'Free for Chat' status.
	 * - Away    refers to a state where you can be technically reached, but
	 *         for one reason or another it is often not useful to do so.
	 *         This can be because you really aren't behind the computer
	 *         ('Away' or 'Idle') or because you have other things to do
	 *         and don't want to get involved in messaging ('Busy' or 'Do
	 *         not Disturb' for example).
	 * - Offline is a state where you really cannot be contacted. Although
	 *         Kopete doesn't oppose any technical limitations it really
	 *         doesn't make sense to have more than one status per protocol
	 *         that maps to 'Offline', since you're supposed to be
	 *         disconnected from the network in this state.
	 * - Connecting is a state where the user is not available on the network yet
	 *         but trying to get onto. Most useful to yourself contact, because
	 *         this state means not visible but with network access
	 * - Unknown refers to protocols where state cannot be determined. This
	 *         applies to SMS contacts (text messages via mobile phones),
	 *         since there's no presence information over SMS, but also
	 *         to e.g. MSN contacts that are not on your contact list,
	 *         since MSN only allows a user to query online state for
	 *         users that are formally on the contact list. Lastly, libkopete
	 *         itself uses the Unknown state in @ref KopeteMetaContact for
	 *         meta contacts that have no child contacts at all.

	 * @param weight is the 'weight' of this status. The contact list is

	 * always takes precedence. Weight is used when the same status is used
	 * more than once. Weight is also used for picking the most important
	 * 'Away' status for a protocol when going Away.
	 * @param protocol is a pointer to the protocol used. This is used when
	 * comparing two states using @ref operator=().
	 * @param internalStatus is the status as used internally by the protocol.
	 * This status is usually a lot more fine-grained than the status as used
	 * by libkopete and should be unique per protocol.
	 * @param overlayIcon is a string returning the name of the status icon to be
	 * used by the KDE icon loader. (Online and Offline don't have icon to overlay
	 * so you should QString::null as icon string)
	 * @param caption is the description of the status in menus and on buttons.
	 * @param description is a description in e.g. tooltips.
