- add 'Reset' button to KConfigureDialog that calls load() in the KCMs
- if the dlg is hidden and show() is called, call load() on the KCMs
- KPluginSelct.. listview should only show the name and comment, the rest is
  shown in a tooltip (I don't know how to get the tooltip working in the
  listview.)
- honor KCModule::buttons() - show/hide buttons accordingly
