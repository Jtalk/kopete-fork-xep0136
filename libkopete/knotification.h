/**
 * KNotification is used to notify some event to the user.
 *
 * It covers severals kind of notifications
 *
 * @li Interface feedback events:
 * For notifying the user that he/she just performed an operation, like maximizing a
 * window. This allows us to play sounds when a dialog appears.
 * This is an instant notification.  It ends automatically after a small timeout
 *
 * @li complex notifications:
 * Notify when one received a new message, or when something important happened
 * the user has to know.  This notification has a start and a end.  It start when
 * the event actually occurs, and finish when the message is acknowledged.
 * 
 * In order to do a notification, you need to create a description files, which contains 
 * default parametters of the notification, and use KNotification::event at the place of the
 * code where the notification occurs.
 * the returned KNotification pointer may be used to connect signals or slots
 *
 * \section file The global config file
 * On installation, there should be a file called 
 *  <em>$KDEDIR/share/apps/appname/eventsrc</em>
 *  This file contains  mainly 3 parts
 *   <ol><li>\ref global "Global information"</li>
 *       <li>\ref context "Context information"</li>
 *       <li>\ref events "Information about every events"</li></ol>
 *  
 *  \subsection global Global information
 * The global part looks like that
 * <pre>
		   [Global]
		   IconName=Filename
		   Comment=Freindly Name of app
 * </pre>
 *   The icon filename is just the name, without extention,  it's found with the KIconLoader
 * 
 * \subsection context Context information
 * 
 * This part is only hints for the configuration widget
 *  <pre>
		   [Context/group]
		   Name=Group name
		   Comment=The name of the group of the contact

		   [Context/folder]
		   Name=Group name
 *  </pre>
 *  the second part of the groupname is the context identifier.
 *  It should not contains special characters.
 *  The Name field is the one the user will see (and which is translated)
 * 
 * \subsection events Description of Events
 * 
 * Now comes the most important,  the description of each events.
 * <pre>
		   [Event/newmail]
		   Name=New email
		   Comment=You have got a new email
		   Contexts=folder,group
		   Action=Sound|Popup

		   [Event/contactOnline]
		   Name=Contact goes online
		   Comment=One of your contact has been connected
		   Contexts=group
		   Sound=filetoplay.ogg
		   Action=None
 *  </pre>
 *   All you put there are the default value.
 *   Action is a bitmask of KNotification::NotifyPresentation
 * 
 *  Contexts is a comma separated list of possible context for this event.
 * 
 *  \section userfile The user's config file
 * 
 *  This is only an implementation detail, for your information.
 * 
 * On the config file, there is two parts:  the events configuration, and the context informations
 * \subsection context Context informations
 *  This is only hints for the configuration dialog. It contains both the internal id of the context, and the user visible string.
 *  <pre>
		   [Context/group]
		   Values=1:Friends,2:Work,3:Family
 *  </pre>
 * \subsection event Events configuration
 *   This contains the configuration of events for the user.
 *   It contains the same fields as the description file.
 *    The key of groups is in the form 
 *  <em>Event/&lt;EventName&gt;/&lt;ContextName&gt;/&lt;ContextValue&gt;</em>
 * <pre>
		   [Event/contactOnline]
		   Action=Sound
		   Sound=/usr/share/sounds/super.ogg

		   [Event/contactOnline/group/1]
		   Action=PassivePopup|Sound
 * </pre>
 * 
 * \section example Example of code
 * 
 * This portion of code will fire the event for the "contactOnline" event
 * 
 * @code
	KNotification::ContextList contexts;
	foreach( QString group , contact->groups() ) {
		contexts.append( qMakePair( QString("group") , group ) );
	}
    
	KNotification *notification=KNotification::event( "contactOnline",
			i18n("The contact <i>%1</i> has gone online").arg( contact->name() ),
			contact->pixmap() , 0l , QStringList( i18n( "Open chat" ) ) , contexts );
	connect(notify, SIGNAL(activated(unsigned int )), contact , SLOT(slotOpenChat()) );
 * @endcode
