This branch is for the Identity support refactory in Kopete. The main point is 
supporting multiple identities, and make things easier.
Some points:

- Each account will belong to exactly one Identity.

- Each identity can have one or more accounts associated to it.

- Accounts can be moved from one identity to another.

- Properties (such as nickname/photo/personal info and so on) will be stored in
  the identity rather than the account.

- Accounts should get/set properties from the identity rather than having their 
  own properties.

- Synchronization will be handle in the following way:
    * If you set a property in the identity, it will be applied to all accounts 
      belonging to this identity
    * If a property changes server-side for one of the accounts in the identity, 
      the user will be asked if he wants to have that property sync from server 
      to the identity (and therefore to all other accounts), and, of course, provide 
      the "Do not ask again" option. If there is only one account in the identity, 
      do not ask and only apply the settings.

- The "Global Identity" will be a convenience for moving all accounts to a single 
  identity (and maybe show an interface to unify the properties that are different 
  in the old identities). The old identities will be removed (this can be discussed 
  though).

- The user info interface will get/set properties from the identity, not from the 
  contact

- The Akonady support will probably be implemented on top of the identity
