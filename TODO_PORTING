Note down all the stuff that still has to be done for porting to Qt4 / KDE4 here.
This is just a start...

User Interface
--------------
- Check that Ui::{DesignerWidget} variables allocated on the heap are always deleted in the destructor.
- Go through all the ui4 files and set the tab order

General
-------
- K Replacement for QTreeWidget, QTreeWidgetItem?
- Remove const char* argument from plugin constructors (needs changed KParts::ComponentsFactory)
- Go through the debug ouput and look for failed QObject::connect()
- Eliminate as many setObjectName() calls as necessary
