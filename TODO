Framework
=========

o KopeteMessageManager, integration of chat sessions, chat window
  managment, notifier display, message queues.
  -> In progress (90% done)
     ASSIGNED: DMV, DS, IRG

o Better chatwindow
  -> Almost finished
     ASSIGNED: MK, RC 
  
+ contact list functionality sharing among plugins
    -> Part of API restructuring (COMPLETED)
       ASSIGNED: MK, RC
  + unified support for groups (icq can move users to any groups, but aim
    can't...)
    -> Part of API restructuring (COMPLETED)
       ASSIGNED: MK, RC
  + unified events - on message, on login/logout, on file transfer...
    -> Part of API restructuring (KopeteMessageManager)
       ASSIGNED: MK, RC
  + global notification api and preferences (right now, only the icq plugin
    seems to use the balloons, and msn/aim pop up a window)
    -> Part of API restructuring (COMPLETED)
       ASSIGNED: MK, RC
  + support for file transfer
    -> Part of KopeteMessageManager
       + Note from DS: KMMF->create() has an int widget flag, USE IT, please.
       ASSIGNED: DS
  + Split KopeteProtocol into KopeteProtocol and KopeteIdentity to allow
    multiple identities using the same protocol
    -> Part of API restructuring
       ASSIGNED: MK, RC

- ui
  + integrate patch for not quitting on close (when there's a way of quitting
    from the systray... what's the status of this ?)
    -> In progress, currently being discussed on kde-core-devel (kdelibs bug)
       ASSIGNED: MK
  + chatwindow like gaim's/trillian's (richtext + send hyperlink + emoticon
    menu + a few extras). maybe use the one from kinkatta, which is nice.
    -> Is this the same as the 'better chatwindow' above?
       + DS: Yes. KMMF->create() has an int capabilities flag, USE IT.
       ASSIGNED: DS
  + notify the user of events. either with sounds or blink something in the
    systray.
    -> Part of gloabl notify API/KopeteMessageManager (COMPLETED).
       ASSIGNED: ?

- msn
  + store the users locally (should this *really* be done? -DS)
    UNASSIGNED

- icq
  + add authorization support
  -> In progress, 50% done
     ASSIGNED: DMV
  + store users on server/icq2001b (although that's more of a kxengine item)
    -> In progress, almost finished in kxicq/kxengine
       ASSIGNED: Herwin "Gompy" Jan Steehouwer (kxicq author)

- Jabber
  + port to Psi code
    -> COMPLETED
  + support multi-user chats
    -> sort of a part of the first point, and KChatWindow
       ASSIGNED: DS
  + support differentiation between messages and chats (use int widget flag)
    -> also half a part of the KChatWindow stuff
       ASSIGNED: DS
