These are random snippets that should give developers a clue of what we have
to fix before the next release.

Beware: It's totally unsorted ;)

================================================================================

- Once and for all fix the way displayName is used in KopeteContact. With
  serverside contact lists it's now impossible to rename contacts on the server
  because some people (e.g. Olivier) want to see the nickname that a user
  assigned and others (e.g. Martijn) want to ALWAYS see the display name of the
  meta contact.
  displayName and nickName should be split and depending on the user's prefs
  displayName() should return either MC->displayName() or nickName().

- Add a way to detect when a protocol goes offline involuntary. In that case
  try a reconnect first and only leave the protocol offline if the reconnect
  fails. Alternatively, retry reconnecting with increasing intervals.

OSCAR ICQ/AIM TODO ITEMS (generously added by mETz *g*)

	OSCAR in general=============================================================
For 0.7
	- somehow sync server and local list, this is not as trivial as everybody
	  always thinks it is because you cannot sure if local changes or
	  serverside-changes caused the difference (think about two clients being used
	  for the same account, one at home and one at work).
	  Update: Actually it might be possible by saving two timestamp/size values
	  for the account. Serverside and local values.
	  Also I'm much in favor of hindering the user from offline editing the
	  contactlist. (Probably just this for 0.7, this is all Jabber allows, anyway)

	- save groupID in KopeteGroups

	- make renaming serverside contacts possible (function is there but fails due
	  to massive contactlist crappyness caused by above mentioned classes)

	X error handling on channel 0x04 messages. properly disconnect and emit a
	  signal in oscarsocket. (Will)

For 1.0/kdenetwork:
	- switch from QSocket to KExtendedSocket,
	  this means rewriting most of oscarsocket
	  The biggest problem I see so far is OscarConnection::setSocket(int socket)
	  because you cannot assign a new socket to a KExtendedSocket AFAICS (I don't
	  like this idea anyway)
	  Also I don't think we need an OscarConnection base class for outgoing
	  connections, we could handle FileConnections, DirectConnections and
	  normal connections by casting, there aren't many areas where one could have
	  a choice of connection type anyway (only thing I see so far is sending an
	  IM, it can be either through-server or through direct connection.

	- don't inherit from a socket class but base our classes on QObject and
	  have a socket() function instead if socket-access is needed.

	- get rid of AIMContactList, AIMBuddy (almost gone already) and AIMGroup.


	ICQ specific ================================================================
For 0.7:
	- IMPORTANT: write plugin data to accounts.xml, and fail gracefully if 
	there is none there instead of giving 
	kopete (oscar): [void OscarAccount::slotGoOnline()] 389743: Already ONLINE
	** See if this is still there after the move back to KConfig
	I noticed it was writing no plugin data to accounts.xml recently, 
	I think a lack of server name and port data there prevents ICQ 
	connecting. (Will, confirmed by Till)
	
	- support simple icq type-2 messages so we can send/receive away 
	messages (yes, I even see this as a point for not releasing 0.7, away 
	messages ARE important or else I could take out away modes altogether)

	- prevent passwords longer than 8 chars, it upsets the server
	- general support for SNAC (0x15,y)
	- read away reasons
	- own away-reasons
	- use html/rtf in own messages (i.e. support type-2 messages, BIG ONE)
	X keepalive for connection to server (icq has ping packets)
	- STOP stupid users from adding their own UIN to the userlist
	- honor encodings for both sides (I need more knowledge about this!)
	- Option: Allow access from contacts on my contact list only
	- group handling
	  (signals: KopeteMetaContact::movedToGroup , addedToGroup , removedToGroup )
	  I'm not sure what this item means, none of the other protocols listen to
	  these signals.
	- ignore lists (needs proper group-handling)
	- invisible list (needs proper group-handling)
	X invisible mode

	- support login with something different than "online" status, both for
	  AIM and ICQ. I thought about changing OscarSocket::doLogin but the var
	  would either contain an icq status long or a simple number for aim, not
	  sure if mixing icq-specific values and plain numbers is a good idea
	  (although possible, we have an isICQ() function anyway)

	- support sending your own icq userinfo to the server,
	  it's easy to do for me but because of the mass of items takes lots of time
	  and is extremely boring.
For 1.0/kdenetwork:
	What's not achievable in the above?  Move it down here...
	AIM specific ================================================================
	- Nothing in here yet, I'd appreciate somebody with more extensive use of
	  AIM to take over just that part of the plugin.

 MSN TODO  (for the Kopete 1.0 release)
---------------------------------------

	- Search for an MSN User
	- Improve the EditAccountWidget, add privacy setting, phone number setting,
	   and a way to handle the ''hidden'' contactlist
	- Handle the MSN PLUS! color codes
	  Handle the MSN6 cutoms emoticon (at least add the capacity to view them)
	- Show internals messages in chat window when filetransfers, and make the
	   possibility to send files without opening previously a chat
