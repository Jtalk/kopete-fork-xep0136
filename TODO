These are random snippets that should give developers a clue of what we have
to fix before the next release.

Beware: It's totally unsorted ;)

================================================================================

- fix account pluginData() handling, it obviously gets lost somehow sometimes

- Fix the segfault-on-exit that's been around for years. Unfortunately nobody
  knows if this is still valid and what segfaults where or why ;)

================================================================================

OSCAR ICQ/AIM TODO ITEMS (generously added by mETz *g*)

	OSCAR in general=============================================================
	- switch from QSocket to KExtendedSocket,
	  this means rewriting most of oscarsocket
	  The biggest problem I see so far is OscarConnection::setSocket(int socket)
	  because you cannot assign a new socket to a KExtendedSocket AFAICS (I don't
	  like this idea anyway)
	  Also I don't think we need an OscarConnection base class for outgoing
	  connections, we could handle FileConnections, DirectConnections and
	  normal connections by casting, there aren't many areas where one could have
	  a choice of connection type anyway (only thing I see so far is sending an
	  IM, it can be either through-server or through direct connection.

	- don't inherit from a socket class but base our classes on QObject and
	  have a socket() function instead if socket-access is needed.

	- get rid of AIMContactList, AIMBuddy (almost gone already) and AIMGroup.

	- save groupID in KopeteGroups

	- somehow sync server and local list, this is not as trivial as everybody
	  always thinks it is because you cannot sure if local changes or
	  serverside-changes caused the difference (think about two clients being used
	  for the same account, one at home and one at work).
	  Update: Actually it might be possible by saving two timestamp/size values
	  for the account. Serverside and local values.
	  Also I'm much in favor of hindering the user from offline editing the
	  contactlist.

	- make renaming serverside contacts possible (function is there but fails due
	  to massive contactlist crappyness caused by above mentioned classes)

	- fix adding contacts for both addcontactwizard and serverside list

	- error handling on channel 0x04 messages. properly disconnect and emit a
	  signal in oscarsocket.

	ICQ specific ================================================================
	- general support for SNAC (0x15,y)
	- read away reasons
	- own away-reasons
	- use html/rtf in own messages (i.e. support type-2 messages, BIG ONE)
	X keepalive for connection to server (icq has ping packets)
	- STOP stupid users from adding their own UIN to the userlist
	- honor encodings for both sides (I need more knowledge about this!)
	- Option: Allow access from contacts on my contact list only
	- group handling
	  (signals: KopeteMetaContact::movedToGroup , addedToGroup , removedToGroup )
	- ignore lists (needs proper group-handling)
	- invisible list (needs proper group-handling)
	X invisible mode

	- support simple icq type-2 messages so we can send/receive away messages
	  (yes, I even see this as a point for not releasing 0.7, away messages ARE
	  important or else I could take out away modes altogether)

	- support login with something different than "online" status, both for
	  AIM and ICQ. I thought about changing OscarSocket::doLogin but the var
	  would either contain an icq status long or a simple number for aim, not
	  sure if mixing icq-specific values and plain numbers is a good idea
	  (although possible, we have an isICQ() function anyway)

	- finish icq userinfo dialog and sending your own icq userinfo to the server,
	  it's easy to do for me but because of the mass of items takes lots of time
	  and is extremely boring.

	AIM specific ================================================================
	- Nothing in here yet, I'd appreciate somebody with more extensive use of
	  AIM to take over just that part of the plugin.
