TODO - Kopete
-------------

This is a very rough draft, so we have something. Feel free to add or modify
your entries, or to beautify this file a bit ;-) - Martijn


- framework
  + better chatwindow
    -> In progress, will become future KopeteChatWindow class
       ASSIGNED: Martijn Klingens ('spaze') and Ryan Cumming ('Phalynx')
  + contact list functionality sharing among plugins
    -> Part of API restructuring
       ASSIGNED: Martijn Klingens ('spaze') and Ryan Cumming ('Phalynx')
  + unified support for groups (icq can move users to any groups, but aim
    can't...)
    -> Part of API restructuring
       ASSIGNED: Martijn Klingens ('spaze') and Ryan Cumming ('Phalynx')
  + unified events - on message, on login/logout, on file transfer...
    -> Part of API restructuring
       ASSIGNED: Martijn Klingens ('spaze') and Ryan Cumming ('Phalynx')
  + global notification api and preferences (right now, only the icq plugin
    seems to use the balloons, and msn/aim pop up a window)
    -> Part of API restructuring
       ASSIGNED: Martijn Klingens ('spaze') and Ryan Cumming ('Phalynx')
  + support for file transfer
    UNASSIGNED
  + add sound support
    UNASSIGNED
  + Split KopeteProtocol into KopeteProtocol and KopeteIdentity to allow
    multiple identities using the same protocol
    -> Part of API restructuring
       ASSIGNED: Martijn Klingens ('spaze') and Ryan Cumming ('Phalynx')

- ui
  + integrate patch for not quitting on close (when there's a way of quitting
    from the systray... what's the status of this ?)
    -> In progress, currently being discussed on kde-core-devel (kdelibs bug)
       ASSIGNED: Martijn Klingens
  + chatwindow like gaim's/trillian's (richtext + send hyperlink + emoticon
    menu + a few extras). maybe use the one from kinkatta, which is nice.
    -> Is this the same as the 'better chatwindow' above?
       UNASSIGNED
  + notify the user of events. either with sounds or blink something in the
    systray.
    -> Is this part of the global notification API?
       UNASSIGNED

- msn
  + store the users locally
    UNASSIGNED

- icq
  + store users on server/icq2001b (although that's more of a kxengine item)
    -> In progress, almost finished in kxicq/kxengine
       ASSIGNED: Herwin Jan Steehouwer ('Gompy'), kxicq author
