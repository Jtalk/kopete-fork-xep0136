These are random snippets that should give developers a clue of what we have
to fix before the next release.

Beware: It's totally unsorted ;)

================================================================================
- Once and for all fix the way displayName is used in KopeteContact. With
  serverside contact lists it's now impossible to rename contacts on the server
  because some people (e.g. Olivier) want to see the nickname that a user
  assigned and others (e.g. Martijn) want to ALWAYS see the display name of the
  meta contact.
  displayName and nickName should be split and depending on the user's prefs
  displayName() should return either MC->displayName() or nickName().

- Add a way to detect when a protocol goes offline involuntary. In that case
  try a reconnect first and only leave the protocol offline if the reconnect
  fails. Alternatively, retry reconnecting with increasing intervals.

- Prevent attempting to send while offline where appropriate

- First time wizard (mETz)

- Import emoticon themes and/or styles (mETz)

- Save the account order in the config file !!!!!!

- Make the chatwindow a plugin (or make all in libkopete to allow this in the
    future without changing the api)   same for the contactlist  (Olivier)

- Interface for application invitations, and better filetransfers support
- KAB integration

OSCAR ICQ/AIM TODO ITEMS (generously added by mETz *g*)

	OSCAR in general=============================================================
For 0.7
	- somehow sync server and local list, this is not as trivial as everybody
	  always thinks it is because you cannot sure if local changes or
	  serverside-changes caused the difference (think about two clients being used
	  for the same account, one at home and one at work).
	  Update: Actually it might be possible by saving two timestamp/size values
	  for the account. Serverside and local values.
	  Also I'm much in favor of hindering the user from offline editing the
	  contactlist. (Probably just this for 0.7, this is all Jabber allows, anyway)

	- save groupID in KopeteGroups

	- make renaming serverside contacts possible (function is there but fails due
	  to massive contactlist crappyness caused by above mentioned classes)

For 1.0/kdenetwork:
	- get rid of AIMContactList, AIMBuddy (almost gone already) and AIMGroup.

	- Maybe base Buffer class on something like QDataStream (if possible),
	  I don't like all the pointer stuff in here

	- possible switch to a libfaim based backend (for both ICQ and AOL)
	  (rather no :P)


	ICQ specific ================================================================
For 0.7:
	- support simple icq type-2 messages so we can send/receive away
	messages (yes, I even see this as a point for not releasing 0.7, away
	messages ARE important or else I could take out away modes altogether)

	- prevent passwords longer than 8 chars, it upsets the server (wrong, 16 are allowed afaics)
	- general support for SNAC (0x15,y)
	- read away reasons
	- own away-reasons
	- use html/rtf in own messages (i.e. support type-2 messages, BIG ONE)
	- honor encodings for both sides (I need more knowledge about this!)
	- Option: Allow access from contacts on my contact list only
	- group handling
	  (signals: KopeteMetaContact::movedToGroup , addedToGroup , removedToGroup )
	  I'm not sure what this item means, none of the other protocols listen to
	  these signals.
	- ignore lists (needs proper group-handling)
	- invisible list (needs proper group-handling)
	- support sending your own icq userinfo to the server,
	  it's easy to do for me but because of the mass of items takes lots of time
	  and is extremely boring.

For 1.0/kdenetwork:
	What's not achievable in the above?  Move it down here...
	AIM specific ================================================================
	- Nothing in here yet, I'd appreciate somebody with more extensive use of
	  AIM to take over just that part of the plugin.

================================================================================


================================================================================
 MSN TODO  (for the Kopete 1.0 release)
---------------------------------------

	- Handle the MSN PLUS! color codes
	- Handle the MSN6 cutoms emoticon (at least add the capacity to view them)
	- Handle the MSN6 buddy icons
	- Show internals messages in chat window when filetransfers (go with the new
	    interface for invitation in libkopete)

	- Search for an MSN User	  (not for Kopete 1.0)

================================================================================
