Kopete, The KDE Messenger

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Kopete is an Instant Messaging client being designed to be modular and
plugin based.

It requires the KDE Desktop, version 3 or higher.

Kopete ships with a lot of protocol plugins, most of which are actively
supported. The MSN, ICQ, AIM, Jabber and IRC plugins have seen numerous
enhancements and bugfixes since the last release and should bring your
Kopete experience to a whole new level.

Additionally there are some new plugins, but not all of them are considered
fully usable yet. The Gadu-Gadu plugin is complete and supported. To use 
Gadu-Gadu plugin you have to set up libgadu in your system, both runtime
and development part. WinPopup should be complete, but is not yet supported 
in this release. The Yahoo plugin and the new Oscar plugin (which is scheduled 
to replace both the ICQ and AIM plugins) are under development and not ready 
for general use yet.

As always, bug reports and patches are welcome, but especially for the new
'unsupported' plugins we'd like you to check the current development version
of Kopete in KDE CVS before filing bug reports or submitting patches. The
code is simply too much subject to change for these plugins.

The Kopete team consists now of several active developers, working on the
various plugins and the core API. However, Kopete wouldn't be in the shape
in which it is now without the various contributions from KDE developers
all over the world and the high-quality bug reports from active users.
Thanks to all of you for your support and your interest in Kopete!

The Kopete main developers can be contacted on our mailing list,
kopete-devel@kde.org.
