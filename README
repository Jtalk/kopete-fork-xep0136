Kopete, The KDE Messenger

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Kopete is an Instant Messaging client designed to be modular and plugin based.

It requires the KDE Desktop, version 3.1 or higher.

Kopete ships with a lot of protocol plugins, supporting nine different IM 
systems.  The MSN, ICQ, AIM, Jabber, Gadu-gadu and IRC plugins have seen 
numerous enhancements and bugfixes since the last release and should bring 
your Kopete experience to a whole new level.

Additionally there are some new plugins.  The Yahoo plugin and the new Oscar 
plugin make their debut with this release.  The Oscar plugin replaces the previous AIM and ICQ plugins with a common codebase based around a newer protocol.
The Gadu-Gadu plugin is complete. To use it you have to set up libgadu in your 
system.  See INSTALL for details.  WinPopup and SMS have seen a lot of clean ups, and are fully supported in this release.  

There are a number of new general plugins that apply to all protocols.  Try out Text Effect, Spell Check, Auto Replace and Highlight.  These demonstrate the advantages of a unified IM client, as you can enjoy rich features without having to learn a different UI for every chat protocol they use.

The Kopete team consists now of several active developers, working on the
various plugins and the core API. However, Kopete wouldn't be in the shape
in which it is now without the various contributions from KDE developers
all over the world and the high-quality bug reports from active users.
Thanks to all of you for your support and your interest in Kopete!

As always, more bug reports and patches are welcome.
