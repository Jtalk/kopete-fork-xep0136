QSSL is a plugin that allows Psi to utilize OpenSSL.


Installation
------------

If this is a source package, then you need to compile before installing.
Skip down to the "Compiling" section in that case.

Otherwise, simply copy the plugin into either your Psi install directory
or $HOME/.psi directory.

  cp libqssl.so /usr/local/share/psi

That's all!  Restart Psi and SSL should work.


Compiling
---------

Compiling requires Qt 3.x and OpenSSL 0.9.6b or higher.  To build:

  % qmake qssl.pro
  % make

If you get an error running qmake, then you don't have a proper Qt 3.x
development environment set up.

If the compile succeeds, then return to the Installation instructions.
