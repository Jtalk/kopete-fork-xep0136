TODO for Jabber:

- support for public channels
- implement support for transports/agents
- support for file transfers
- allow synchronization of offline changes / online changes
- find out about Jabber server-side filtering components and if they can be
  integrated into the Kopete filtering API
- support all message types (chat/ticker/etc)
- do a std translation of resource.status().show() to JabberProtocol::Presence
- fix contact adding/removing
- verify sane state of a) metacontact handling (adding to list) b) contact handling (tracking changes)
- fix server browsing
- make warning about changed preferences while being online work again
  (JabberPreferences::save())
- fix initial presence notification (is set to offline - myContact problem?)
- fix initial presence setting
- dlgjabberservices.cpp: prepopulate the server field in the ctor, slotQuery()
- *jabberstatus* can most likely be deleted?
- when starting with an empty account, either display preferences or delete the code
  that checks for it (jabberaccount.cpp:235 JabberAccount::connect())
- in JabberAccount::disconnect(), the iteration about the contacts to set the offline should be obsolete and incorrect
- JabberAccount::setAway() has a b0rked implementation?
- JabberAccount::slotGoAway() etc. don't use the global away dialog
- get rid of the identity stuff in JabberContact
- JabberContact has a few inactivated methods regarding subscribing/unsubscribing
- verify groupchat
- JabberAccount::slotSettingsChanged() serves no purpose?
- use connecting state for kopete online status instead of isConnecting in JabberAccount
- using "online" presence emits "Going online"?
- going away globally does not allow returning to online mode
- should the away dialog pop up when going away using the account context menu?
