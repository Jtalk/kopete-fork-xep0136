TODO for Jabber:

- implement support for transports/agents
  (waiting for libpsi support)
- make sure that messages sent via a gateway from a non-subscribed contact
  are actually displayed
- allow synchronization of offline changes / online changes
- find out about Jabber server-side filtering components and if they can be
  integrated into the Kopete filtering API
- implement support for registration forms etc
- support all message types (chat/ticker/etc)
- set correct timestamps for messages
- do a std translation of resource.status().show() to JabberProtocol::Presence
- JabberProtocol and JabberContact are now friends. Move all methods that only
  relate to the API between them to private
- JabberPreferences: click on apply, jabber plugin must go offline to save the new settings
