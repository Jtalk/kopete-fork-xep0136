TODO for Jabber:

- support for public channels
- implement support for transports/agents
- support for file transfers
- allow synchronization of offline changes / online changes
- find out about Jabber server-side filtering components and if they can be
  integrated into the Kopete filtering API
- support all message types (chat/ticker/etc)
- do a std translation of resource.status().show() to JabberProtocol::Presence
- verify sane state of a) metacontact handling (adding to list) b) contact handling (tracking changes)
- in JabberAccount::disconnect(), the iteration about the contacts to set the offline should be obsolete and incorrect
- JabberAccount::setAway() has a b0rked implementation?
- JabberAccount::slotGoAway() etc. don't use the global away dialog
- when going online, setPresence() is called twice, once too early -> investigate
- using "online" presence emits "Going online"?
- going away globally does not allow returning to online mode
- should the away dialog pop up when going away using the account context menu?
- verify FIXMEs in JabberContact
- group chat needs a bit of rework
- when opening the prefs dialog, make sure that the password dialog does not pop up
- add a button for server defaults
- on a failed connection attempt, the animation does not stop
- going offline does not stop the animation after a failed connection attempt
- empty hostname makes Jabber crash (faulty NDNS)
- port dialogs to KDialogBase
- make sure that contact context menus use the same terms (email message vs. chat message)
- in slotGotVCard() there's a change nickname method, check that it does not
  collide with "rename contact" (change alias) -> disabled for now
