TODO for Jabber:

- update status is not signalled after a new contact has been added
- check renaming
- check moving between groups
- check if pending subscriptions are displayed
  + they should be displayed as offline. status icon for this, maybe? -DS
- check if incoming auth requests are properly added
  + last time I checked, yes -DS
- implement support for transports/agents
  + Psi has support for this, should be reasonably easy -DS
