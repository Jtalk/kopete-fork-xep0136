TODO for Jabber (kdepsi branch):

- update status is not signalled after a new contact has been added
- check if pending subscriptions are displayed
  + they should be displayed as offline. status icon for this, maybe? -DS
- check if incoming auth requests are properly added
  + last time I checked, yes -DS
- implement support for transports/agents
  + Psi has support for this, should be reasonably easy -DS
- update to the new away system
  [11:11:28] <Ph0nk> you can get a list of titles via: KopeteAway::getInstance()->getTitles();
  [11:11:32] <Ph0nk> returns a QStringList
  [11:11:40] <Ph0nk> can use it to populate a drop down list
  [11:11:57] <Ph0nk> and then KopeteAway::getInstance()->getMessage(QString title)
- make sure that messages sent via a gateway from a non-subscribed contact
  are actually displayed
- check if vCards are actually deleted after having retrieved them
- moving a user currently does seem to pass on the correct parameters to the protocol
  backend, however, slotUpdate() is not called on the contact in return after a
  successful move. check that this doesn't lead to data corruption or data loss
- add support for multiple groups per contact (enabled in next Psi lib)
- allow synchronization of offline changes / online changes, this requires adding
  groups to the serialized data
- group() does not seem to work with JabberContact serialization
- BUG: make sure that unsubscriptions from other users actually update the roster!
- find out about Jabber server-side filtering components and if they can be
  integrated into the Kopete filtering API
- make Jabber load all contacts belonging to a certain identity, display all
  as offline if they don't belong to the current identity
- Setting your status to away and changing it back again does not seem to work.
  Selectively setting your status to away for a certain contact does not seem
  to work at all.
- make sure that JabberPreferences is updated (remove email widget etc)
- registering is implemented i don't know if it works yet, the task is fired
  but do i have to connect a signal to see if it worked? am i logged in after
  registering? MAKE IT AN EXTRA FUNCTION IN THE GUI
- currently determining the away status does _not_ work. find out how to do that
  with Psi
- implement support for transports, gateways etc
- implement support for registration forms etc
- verify that invisible works
- verify that setting oneself from offline to <away/na/xa/etc> connects and works
- add vcard support, currently missing in libpsi
- need to verify SSL, couldn't get it to work on amessage.de
- send presence to node has to be adopted so that it sends to the current
  resource (if override is in effect)
- support all message types (chat/ticker/etc)
- set correct timestamps for messages
- do a std translation of resource.status().show() to JabberProtocol::Presence
- Scenario: A asks B for authorization to a subscription. B auths and asks
  A in return. A auths. B removes A from its roster but does not unsubscribe.
  A later sends a message to B.
  - make sure that A appropriately gets a new contact created
  - make sure that A gets a menu item allowing to unsubscribe
- upon delete, the metacontact stays. make sure that it either disappears
  completely or at least updates its status
- find out if slotContactDestroyed() is called before the contact is destroyed
  or not. If called before, update contactMap as well as metaContactMap
