TODO for Jabber:

- update status is not signalled after a new contact has been added
- check if pending subscriptions are displayed
  + they should be displayed as offline. status icon for this, maybe? -DS
- check if incoming auth requests are properly added
  + last time I checked, yes -DS
- implement support for transports/agents
  + Psi has support for this, should be reasonably easy -DS
- update to the new away system
  [11:11:28] <Ph0nk> you can get a list of titles via: KopeteAway::getInstance()->getTitles();
  [11:11:32] <Ph0nk> returns a QStringList
  [11:11:40] <Ph0nk> can use it to populate a drop down list
  [11:11:57] <Ph0nk> and then KopeteAway::getInstance()->getMessage(QString title)
- make sure that messages sent via a gateway from a non-subscribed contact
  are actually displayed
- check if vCards are actually deleted after having retrieved them
- moving a user currently does seem to pass on the correct parameters to the protocol
  backend, however, slotUpdate() is not called on the contact in return after a
  successful move. check that this doesn't lead to data corruption or data loss
- when having one contact in several groups at the same time, this needs to be
  emulated via the serialization API somehow
- allow synchronization of offline changes / online changes, this requires adding
  groups to the serialized data
- group() does not seem to work with JabberContact serialization
- "Re(send) authorization to" and "Rerequest athorization from" like in PSI client by robertgogolok at gmx.de (gogo@myjabber.net)
- seemingly Jabber supports multiple groups per contact (Gabber does support
  this at least). Implement it! (JabberContact::group needs to be a QStringList
  etc)
- BUG: make sure that unsubscriptions from other users actually update the roster!
- find out about Jabber server-side filtering components and if they can be
  integrated into the Kopete filtering API
