- support for file transfers
- allow synchronization of offline changes / online changes
- find out about Jabber server-side filtering components and if they can be
  integrated into the Kopete filtering API
- support all message types (chat/ticker/etc)
- do a std translation of resource.status().show() to JabberProtocol::Presence
- fix contact adding/removing
- verify sane state of a) metacontact handling (adding to list) b) contact handling (tracking changes)
- fix server browsing
- make warning about changed preferences while being online work again
  (JabberPreferences::save())
