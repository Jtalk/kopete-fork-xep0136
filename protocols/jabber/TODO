TODO for Jabber:

- update status is not signalled after a new contact has been added
- check renaming
- check moving between groups
- check if pending subscriptions are displayed
  + they should be displayed as offline. status icon for this, maybe? -DS
- check if incoming auth requests are properly added
  + last time I checked, yes -DS
- implement support for transports/agents
  + Psi has support for this, should be reasonably easy -DS
- update to the new away system
  [11:11:28] <Ph0nk> you can get a list of titles via: KopeteAway::getInstance()->getTitles();
  [11:11:32] <Ph0nk> returns a QStringList
  [11:11:40] <Ph0nk> can use it to populate a drop down list
  [11:11:57] <Ph0nk> and then KopeteAway::getInstance()->getMessage(QString title)
- make sure that messages sent via a gateway from a non-subscribed contact
  are actually displayed
- check if vCards are actually deleted after having retrieved them
- serious flaw: when a new contact tries to subscribe, Kopete sends the acknowledgement
  but does not subscribe to the new contact in return - however, Kopete creates a meta-
  contact for this contact. This leads to the effect that Kopete displays an
  "always offline" contact that can receive messages but not display its
  online status. Fix: add a "ack, subscribe" and "ack, don't subscribe" to the
  subscription dialog
