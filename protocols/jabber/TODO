TODO for Jabber:

- support for public channels
- implement support for transports/agents
- support for file transfers
- allow synchronization of offline changes / online changes
- find out about Jabber server-side filtering components and if they can be
  integrated into the Kopete filtering API
- support all message types (chat/ticker/etc)
- do a std translation of resource.status().show() to JabberProtocol::Presence
- verify sane state of a) metacontact handling (adding to list) b) contact handling (tracking changes)
- make warning about changed preferences while being online work again
  (JabberPreferences::save())
- when starting with an empty account, either display preferences or delete the code
  that checks for it (jabberaccount.cpp:235 JabberAccount::connect())
- in JabberAccount::disconnect(), the iteration about the contacts to set the offline should be obsolete and incorrect
- JabberAccount::setAway() has a b0rked implementation?
- JabberAccount::slotGoAway() etc. don't use the global away dialog
- when going online, setPresence() is called twice, once too early -> investigate
- using "online" presence emits "Going online"?
- going away globally does not allow returning to online mode
- should the away dialog pop up when going away using the account context menu?
- verify FIXMEs in JabberContact
- save "auto connect" in account preferences
- group chat needs a bit of rework
- ignore presence information from other resources of myContact
  (using Psi with the same account and going offline in Psi causes Kopete
   to treat that information as if it went offline itself)
