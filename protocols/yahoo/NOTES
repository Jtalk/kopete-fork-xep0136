2003-07-05 - Things to do for after 0.7

- Update libyahoo2 to the latest version and port it to use the QT/KDE classes
  so we get things like proxy support, IPv6, etc.
- Implement file transfers
- Implement group chats (using both yahoo groups and multiple person chats)
- Implement color handling as soon as I find a way to get a client
  to send me colored text.
- Delete contacts from the server side list when deleting them from 
  Kopete. 
- Main thing to note is invisible mode, which won't work if you go straight from
    offline->invisible, since it will go offline->online->invisible and the
    opposite end will notice you go online.
- When deleteing contacts from kopete's contact list, they aren't deleted from
  the server side list
