2003.04.06 - General status
Pretty much all basic functionality is there now.
Chatting works fine, away messages fine, contact status fine.
All away modes are supported, except idle, cos I don't know what to do with it.
Main thing to note is invisible mode, which won't work if you go straight from
  offline->invisible, since it will go offline->online->invisible and the
  opposite end will notice you go online.
