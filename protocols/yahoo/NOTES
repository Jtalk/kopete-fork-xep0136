2003-06-10 - General Status (mattr)
- color handling doesn't work, and neither does font handling
    so basically, if the person on the other side has some custom fonts,
    we won't be able to see them
- XSL parsing works now.
- The yahoo plugin crashes kopete while using a custom away mode
- Pretty much all basic functionality is there now.
- Main thing to note is invisible mode, which won't work if you go straight from
    offline->invisible, since it will go offline->online->invisible and the
    opposite end will notice you go online.
