2003-07-05 - Considered Releaseable
- Font handling now works, and AFAICT I can't do color handling
- The yahoo plugin no longer crashes when setting a custom away mode
- Display of a custom away mode now works.
- All the basic functionality is there.
- Main thing to note is invisible mode, which won't work if you go straight from
    offline->invisible, since it will go offline->online->invisible and the
    opposite end will notice you go online.
- When deleteing contacts from kopete's contact list, they aren't deleted from
  the server side list
