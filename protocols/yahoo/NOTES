2003-06-10 - General Status (mattr)
The config dialog doesn't destroy itself when unloaded.
XSL parsing works now.
kopete currently crashes with a custom away mode
Pretty much all basic functionality is there now.
Main thing to note is invisible mode, which won't work if you go straight from
  offline->invisible, since it will go offline->online->invisible and the
  opposite end will notice you go online.
