Prompt user to accept, deny, or warn incoming DirectIM and file transfer requests
Make Buffer inherit QByteArray, get rid of possibly error prone c-style array code
Add support for File Transfers
Add support for buddy icons
Add support for sending/receiving buddy lists
Add support for reverse connections for both file transfers and direct IM (this is used when one client is behind a firewall that does not allow direct connections)
Handling of 0x0001/0x000b (Server pause) snac: this will be very difficult to debug since that server command is very rare

Long Term:
Remove all legacy TAim code: TBuddy, TBuddyList, etc.
