- Prompt user to accept, deny, or warn incoming DirectIM and file transfer requests
- Add ability to abort, pause, and resume transfers
- Make Buffer inherit QByteArray, get rid of possibly error prone c-style array code
- Add support for directory transfers
- Add support for buddy icons
- Add GetFile support
- Add support for sending/receiving buddy lists
- Add support for reverse connections for both file transfers and direct IM
  (this is used when one client is behind a firewall that does not allow direct connections)
- Handling of SNAC(0x0001,0x000b) (Server pause) This will be very difficult to debug
  since that server command is very rare
- See what we can do about plugin loading speed.. seems very slow on my machine
