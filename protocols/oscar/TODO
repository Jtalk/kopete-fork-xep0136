- general support for SNAC (0x15, *)
- fix adding contacts for both addcontactwizard and serverside list
- read away reasons
X own away-reasons
X support type-2 messages
- use rtf in own messages
X keepalive for connection to server (icq has ping packets)
X STOP stupid users from adding their own UIN to the userlist
X honor encodings for both sides (I need more knowledge about this!)
- Option: Allow access from contacts on my contact list only
- group handling in general
- ignore lists (needs proper group-handling)
- invisible list (needs proper group-handling)
X invisible mode

- error handling on channel 0x04 messages. properly disconnect and emit a
  signal in oscarsocket.

- get rid of AIMContactList, AIMBuddy (almost gone already) and AIMGroup.

- save groupID in KopeteGroups

- somehow sync server and local list, this is not as trivial as everybody
  always thinks it is because you cannot sure if local changes or
  serverside-changes caused the difference (think about two clients being used
  for the same account, one at home and one at work).

- make renaming serverside contacts possible (function is there but fails due
  to massive contactlist crappyness caused by above mentioned classes)

- support logging in with something different than "online" status for AIM

- finish icq userinfo dialog and sending your own icq userinfo to the server,
  it's easy to do but because of the mass of items takes lots of time
  and is extremely boring.
