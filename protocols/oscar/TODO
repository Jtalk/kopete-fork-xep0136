  THINGS FOR THE SPLIT UP [written by mETz, these notes are to be removed!]
- most important: find a sane replacement for OscarProtocol::protocol()
  - fix calls of *Protocol::getOnlineStatus() all over the place
    (used in conjunction with aboves ugly static ;))
- finish OscarAccount and OscarContact split up (i.e. find out what can be generalized)
- fix possible stupidity inside OscarProtocol
- make aim and icq compile with new base classes (I'll help on icq)
- fix and add GUI parts in aim/icq (I will help on that one)

- handle incorrect account id/password, notify the user
- correctly return to offline if bad password
- fix the account edit widget so it is possible to edit existing accounts

  OLDER STUFF
- Prompt user to accept, deny, or warn incoming DirectIM and file transfer requests
- Add ability to abort, pause, and resume transfers
- Make Buffer inherit QByteArray, get rid of possibly error prone c-style array code
- Add support for directory transfers
- Add support for buddy icons
- Add GetFile support
- Add support for sending/receiving buddy lists
- Add support for reverse connections for both file transfers and direct IM
  (this is used when one client is behind a firewall that does not allow direct connections)
- Handling of SNAC(0x0001,0x000b) (Server pause) This will be very difficult to debug
  since that server command is very rare
- See what we can do about plugin loading speed.. seems very slow on my machine
